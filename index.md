# Hey There!

Welcome to my Website! It is mainly thought of as a fun little project. 

Maybe I'll try to start a blog[^1], where I will give my two cents on various [scientific](/blog/science) as well as  [meta-scientific](/blog/meta_science/) topics (e.g. mental health; climate justice in academia). 

I'm also an active maintainer of the [Unfold.jl toolbox family](https://unfoldtoolbox.github.io/UnfoldDocs/main/). 

If you don't know me, want to contact me or just feel like stalking me, head over to the [About Me](/AboutMe/) section.


[^1]: Update 2025: that _really_ didn't work out so far...
