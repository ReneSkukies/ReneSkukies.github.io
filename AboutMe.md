    Hey, <br>
    <br>
    my name is René Skukies. Currently, I am a PhD Student in the Computational Cognitive Science group. We are situated at the University of Stuttgart and part of the <a href="https://www.simtech.uni-stuttgart.de"> SimTech Institute</a>. My CV (as of 03.2023) can be found <a href="https://kdrive.infomaniak.com/app/share/697625/d53a1268-132e-4605-bd2f-7e34c683529c"> here</a>.
    <br>
    <br>
    I am interested, and working on, the development and validation of new neuroscientific methods, specifically for signal analysis of M/EEG recordings. The main focus of my PhD is to investigate the uses and further developments of the regression-ERP approach. I am additionally interested in (multimodal) perception, awareness and consciousness.
    <br>
    <br>
    Lastly, if I'm not doing science I enjoy hiking, climbing, bee keeping and generally being out in nature. To get an idea of how that looks (and partly to make me look more human than just a wall of text) <a href="https://kdrive.infomaniak.com/app/share/697625/39d336a5-304e-43e6-8d44-66378f26f1ef"> here are some pictures of me in the wild</a>
