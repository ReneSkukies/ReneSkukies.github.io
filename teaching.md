## Pluto Notebooks

A while ago I organized a small workshop on overlap correction and Unfold. To make it more interactively I created a Pluto notebook, which you can freely explore yourself here: [https://github.com/ReneSkukies/PlutoNotebooks](https://github.com/ReneSkukies/PlutoNotebooks)

If I make more such interactive explorations I will add them as well.
